# SmallPrograms
This profile includes some small programs for combinations of other programs.

table_list_fastqc.py is a program designed for FastQC data analysis. If you have already set a folder for FastQC result output (e.g. in path/), you can use this program to combine all results together in fastqc_summary.csv simply by:

python table_list_fastqc.py -i path/ 


table_list_metaphlan.py is a program designed for MetaPhlAn2 data analysis. If you have already set a folder for MetaPhlAn2 result output (e.g. in path/), you can use this program to combine all results together in metaphlan_output.csv simply by:

python table_list_metaphlan.py -i path/

Further programs are under development.
